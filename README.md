**Description** 

I am a:

* Software Engineer
* A UX Designer 	
* A Systems Administrator 	
* A SCRUM and Kanban Coach
* Yogi
* Minimalist
* Collaborator


I work best in a collaborative environments where feedback is given and welcomed. People will regularly review each other's work as a team in a growth mindset format. I like to help facilitate to ensure things run on time. Although I'm friendly and silly, I am very task focused and like to implement and follow a process. To get work done I tend to need to avoid interruptions and aim to be places early so I can crack on. Headphones are extremely useful in this. I have a directness which is never intended as rude, but sometimes can come across that way. I always have the best intentions when offering feedback, and am learning to do so in a less direct manner.

### Feedback

I like to work on collaborative documents where everyone is able to comment and leave feedback. Google Docs/Slides etc is great at this. In development Github has a feature called pull requests which allow people to review and provide positive feedback. I believe this exists in Sketch using Abstract. I am also happy to be given personal feedback in person. I recently listened to a podcast on giving and receiving feedback, which encouraged us to use UX principles like asking "tell me about the last time you felt this way" to help a person recall previous instances, and to take it seriously - not to simply double down on an explanation of why something was that way.

In Summary:

* Design	Crits 	
* Written feedback on collaborative sites like Google Docs.


### Learning
I like learning both on my own and in classroom environments. I have studied with a range of methods, including formal academia, books, youtube tutorials, talks & conferences, workshops and lunchtime learning clubs.
