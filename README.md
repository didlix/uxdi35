**Description** 

I'm a 

- Software Engineer
- A UX Designer
- A Systems Administrator
- A SCRUM and Kanban Coach. 

_I work best in a collaborative environments_ where feedback is given and welcomed. People will reguarly review eachother's work as a team in a growth mindset format. I like to help facilitate to ensure things run on time. Although I'm friendly and silly, I am very task focused and like to implement and follow a process. To get work done I tend to need to avoid interuptions and aim to be places early so I can _crack on_. Headphones are super useful in this. From my German heritager I have a directness which is never intended as rude, but sometimes can come across that way. I always have the best intentions when offering feedback, and am learning to do so in a less direct manner.


**Feedback**

I like to work on collaborative documents where everyone is able to comment and leave feedback. Google Docs/Slides etc is great at this. In development Github has a thing called _pull requests_ which allow people to review and provide positive feedback. I believe this exists in Setch using Abstract. I am also happy to be given personal feedback in person. I recently listewned to a podcast on giving and receiving feedback, which encouraged us to use UX principles like asking "Tell me about the last time you felt this way" to help a person recall the last time. And to take it seriously, not just double down on an explanation of why something was the way it was.

In Summary:

- Design Crits
- Written feedback on collaborative sites like Google Docs.

**Learning**

I like learning both on my own and in classroom environments. I have learned every which way, acadamia, books, youtube tutorials, talks, conferences, workshops and lunchtime learning cliubs.
